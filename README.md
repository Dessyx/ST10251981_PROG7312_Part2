## üíø BACKEND ARCHITECTURE  

**Data Management**  
- Reports represented by `IssueReport` model: ReferenceNumber, Location, Category, Description, Attachments, CreatedUtc  
- Attachments stored in `Attachment` model with FileName, ContentType, StoredPath, and LengthBytes  
- Multi-step submission uses `IssueReportCreateRequest` to handle user input and file queue  

**Custom Data Structures**  
- `DoublyLinkedList<T>` to manage attachments  
- `Queue<T>` for handling file uploads in FIFO order  
- Both structures are generic and lightweight, built for in-memory operations  

**Map Integration (Leaflet.js)**  
- OpenStreetMap tiles for geolocation  
- Status color-coded pins: red, yellow, green  
- Pop-ups for ‚ÄúStill a Problem‚Äù or ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù confirmations  

**Form Handling**  
- Multi-step form validation and progress tracking  
- File upload support with queue management  
- Success modal with reference number and copy-to-clipboard  

**Security Features**  
- Input validation on all fields  
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## üß© Data Structures Used in CityPulse (with Reasons)

### üîß Custom Data Structures (in Domain.cs)

**DoublyLinkedList<T>**

- **Used for:** Attachments in IssueReport
- **Why:** Allows quick adding/removing files at both ends. You can move forwards and backwards easily without resizing like an array.
- **Also used for:** Location suggestions seed data ‚Äî shows our own custom structure and lets us loop through stored locations smoothly.

**Queue<T> (Custom)**

- **Used for:** File upload queue in IssueReportCreateRequest
- **Why:** Works in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) way, which fits how uploads are processed ‚Äî the first file added is the first one uploaded.
- **Also used for:** Returning location suggestions in the order they appear.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Built-in .NET Data Structures (in AnnouncementService)

**SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Announcement>>**

- **Used for:** Main announcement storage.
- **Why:** Keeps announcements sorted by date automatically and allows fast date searches (O(log n)).

**Dictionary<AnnouncementCategory, List<Announcement>>**

- **Used for:** Category-based lookup.
- **Why:** Makes it quick (O(1)) to get announcements in a certain category like Events or Notices.

**Dictionary<Guid, Announcement>**

- **Used for:** Finding announcements by ID.
- **Why:** Fast O(1) lookup for specific announcements without searching through all items.

**Dictionary<string, HashSet<Guid>>**

- **Used for:** Text search index.
- **Why:** Maps keywords to announcement IDs for quick searching. You can find results fast by intersecting sets of matching words.

**HashSet<string>**

- **Used for:** Storing unique categories.
- **Why:** Automatically avoids duplicates and allows instant O(1) checks for category existence.

**HashSet<DateTime>**

- **Used for:** Unique announcement dates.
- **Why:** Ensures no duplicate dates and helps create a clean list for date filters or calendar views.

**PriorityQueue<Announcement, int>**

- **Used for:** Featured or high-priority announcements.
- **Why:** Keeps announcements sorted by priority (Critical, High, etc.) so the most important ones show first.

**Stack<Announcement>**

- **Used for:** Tracking recently viewed announcements.
- **Why:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order matches how users revisit their last viewed announcements.

**Queue<Announcement>**

- **Used for:** Pending announcements waiting for admin approval.
- **Why:** FIFO order ensures fairness ‚Äî the first submitted is reviewed first.

### üìã Standard Collections

**List<T>**

- **Used for:** Return types and temporary collections.
- **Why:** Easy to use, supports LINQ, allows indexing, and resizes automatically. It's great for MVC views.
