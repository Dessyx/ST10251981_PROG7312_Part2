# Security Implementation - Admin Authentication

## Overview
The admin authentication system has been enhanced with industry-standard security practices to protect credentials.

## Security Features

### 1. **Password Hashing (PBKDF2)**
- Passwords are **never stored in plain text**
- Uses **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with **SHA-256**
- **10,000 iterations** for enhanced security against brute-force attacks
- Each password has a unique **16-byte random salt**

### 2. **Secure Data Structure**
- Admin credentials stored in a `Dictionary<string, string>`
- **Key**: Username (case-insensitive)
- **Value**: Hashed password (Base64 encoded)
- Singleton service ensures credentials persist across requests

### 3. **How It Works**

#### Registration/Seeding
```
Plain Password: "Admin@123!"
        ↓
Generate Random Salt (16 bytes)
        ↓
Hash Password with PBKDF2 + Salt (10,000 iterations, SHA-256)
        ↓
Combine Salt + Hash (48 bytes total)
        ↓
Convert to Base64 String
        ↓
Store in Dictionary: { "admin": "Base64HashString" }
```

#### Login Validation
```
User enters: username + password
        ↓
Retrieve stored hash from Dictionary
        ↓
Extract salt from stored hash
        ↓
Hash entered password with same salt
        ↓
Compare hashes byte-by-byte
        ↓
Grant access if match
```

## Implementation Details

### Services Created

#### `IAdminAuthenticationService` (Interface)
- `bool ValidateCredentials(string username, string password)` - Validates login
- `bool UserExists(string username)` - Checks if user exists

#### `AdminAuthenticationService` (Implementation)
- **Data Structure**: `Dictionary<string, string>` for credential storage
- **Hash Algorithm**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **Salt**: 16 bytes, randomly generated per password
- **Iterations**: 10,000
- **Thread-Safe**: Registered as Singleton

### Default Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `Admin@123!`
- Password is hashed immediately on service initialization

## Benefits

✅ **No Plain Text Storage** - Passwords never stored in readable format
✅ **Salt Protection** - Each password has unique salt, preventing rainbow table attacks
✅ **Slow Hashing** - 10,000 iterations slows down brute-force attempts
✅ **Industry Standard** - Uses PBKDF2, recommended by NIST
✅ **Case-Insensitive Usernames** - Better user experience
✅ **Data Structure Utilization** - Dictionary for O(1) lookup performance

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Password Hashing**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
2. **Salting**: Unique salt per password
3. **Constant-Time Comparison**: Prevents timing attacks
4. **Secure Random**: Uses `RandomNumberGenerator` for salt generation
5. **No Password Logging**: Passwords never logged or exposed

## Testing

To test the secure authentication:
1. Navigate to: `/Admin/Login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `Admin@123!`
3. The system will hash the input and compare securely

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add ability to create new admin users
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add account lockout after failed attempts
- Implement 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- Store credentials in a database instead of in-memory
- Add password complexity requirements
- Implement password expiration policies
